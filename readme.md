# Solar System Simulation

pygame 2.5.1

Accurate scaled down simulation of the solar system using real data and physics.
The celestial bodies are not to scale because they would either be invisible next to the sun or the sun would swallow the whole screen.
The real radii for all celestial bodies were used to track data correctly but the render is scaled using my personal preference.

One thing that really struck me while making this simulation was realizing just how huge the universe really is as i was perplexed to why
the orbits of Jupiter and further away planets from sun were not visible in my simulation. Only after resizing my window so much i was able to see Jupiter and Saturn, spreading it across my 2 monitors i was even able to catch Uranus.

I hope you have fun messing around with this as i think of more stuff to add to it.
